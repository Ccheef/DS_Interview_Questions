These are open-ended questions. I just provide some ideas for solution. <h4>

**1. In 2011 Facebook launched Messenger as a stand alone app for mobile devices (it used to only be part of the Facebook App). How would you track the performance of this new application? What metrics would you use?**
* Daily Active Users(DAU) and Monthly Active Users(MAU): Very common metrics. We can use the metrics to compare before and after the App launched,
to see whether the users have moved to the app. We can also calculate the Stickiness Ratio = DAU / MAU
* Total Time Spent: Also very common metric, especially for the App heavily relies on the advertisement for revenues. 
We can use this metric before and after the launching of the stand alone App to check how users change their engagement
* Number of messages sent and response time for received message: We can use the these metrics to check whether users are more engaged with the App and easier for them to respond the messages as they don't have to login Facebook.
Also remember, having high number of messages sent not necessary a good thing as there might be some technical issues that users have to repeatedly send messages or etc.
