**You call 3 friends who live in Seattle and ask each of them independently whether Seattle is raining. Each of your friends has 2/3 chance telling you the truth while 1/3 chance mess with you by lying. You get 3 Yes from your friends. You also know that in any given day, there is 25% Seattle is raining. What is the probability that Seattle is actually raining?**
* Use Bayes' rule. P(rain | 3 Yes) = P(3 Yes| rain)* P(rain)/P(3 Yes) = P(3 Yes| rain)* P(rain) / (P(3 Yes| rain)* P(rain) + P(3 Yes| not rain)* P(not rain)) = (2/3)^3 * 1/4 / ((2/3)^3 * 1/4 + (1/3)^3 * 3/4)) = 8/11
