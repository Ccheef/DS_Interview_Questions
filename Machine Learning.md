**1. What are the main assumptions of linear regression? What are the most common types of linear regression (most common estimation techniques)?**
* The two main assumptions: 1. The relationship between independent variable X and dependent variable Y should be linear. 2. The residual errors from the regression fit should be normally distributed. 
* The common types: 1. Ordinary Least Squares 2. Generalized Least Squares ([see OLS and GLS difference](https://www.quora.com/Regression-statistics-What-is-the-difference-between-Ordinary-least-square-and-generalized-least-squares)) 3.Penalized Least Squares (Lasso and Ridge)
