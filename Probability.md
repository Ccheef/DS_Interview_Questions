**You are given a fair coin. On average, how many flips would you need to get two of the same flip in a row (either 2 heads in a row or 2 tails in a row)?**
* Expected Flips = 2 * 1/2 + 3 * 1/4 + 4 * 1/8 + .... = 3. Refer [the post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/112726/tossing-a-fair-coin-until-two-consecutive-tosses-are-the-same) for detailed explanation.
