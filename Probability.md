**You are given a fair coin. On average, how many flips would you need to get two of the same flip in a row (either 2 heads in a row or 2 tails in a row)?**
* Expected Flips = 2 * 1/2 + 3 * 1/4 + 4 * 1/8 + .... = 3. Refer [the post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/112726/tossing-a-fair-coin-until-two-consecutive-tosses-are-the-same) for detailed explanation.

**What is the probability of rolling a total of sum 4 with two dice?**
* There are total 36 ways to throw. 3 ways can sum to 4: (1,3),(2,2),(3,1). So 3/36 = 1/12

**What is the probability of rolling at least one 4 with two dice?**
* We have 10 ways to have only one dice to be 4. 1 way to have both dice to be 4. so, p = 11/36
